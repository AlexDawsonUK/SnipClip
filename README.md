Website for HiTechy SnipClip.

SnipClip was a lightweight code snippet manager for Windows that sat in the system tray until it was required. It had the benefits of multiple language support and a XML based API which allowed for expansion to support additional languages and formats. It could also run on portable drives (and the data was portable and used an open format as well). While discontinued, it still works on Windows.
